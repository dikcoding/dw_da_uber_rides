# 📊 Uber Ride Analytics Workflow

This repository contains **Data Analyst (DA)** and **Data Engineering (DE)** workflows based on the [Uber Ride Bookings]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard?select=ncr_ride_bookings.csv) dataset from Kaggle.  
The dataset includes detailed ride transaction records such as **Booking ID, Ride Status, Pickup & Drop locations, Vehicle type, and Timestamps** from the Uber platform.

## 🔹 Analyzing Requirements

### 📂 Data Source
- Dataset from Kaggle: *Uber Ride Bookings*.  
- Covers **daily and weekly ride transactions**.  
- Primary source: Uber ride-hailing platform data.  

### 📊 Data Quality
- **Completeness**: Some rides have incomplete info (e.g., missing drop-off, cancelled rides).  
- **Consistency**: Standardized booking status (Completed, Cancelled by Driver, Cancelled by Customer, etc.), but requires validation.  
- **Missing Values**: Certain columns (e.g., Avg VTAT, Avg CTAT) may contain nulls.  
- **Accuracy**: Dataset represents Uber transactions but may not fully reflect global data.  

### 🔗 Integration
- External **weather data** → analyze impact of weather on ride demand.  
- **Traffic/road condition data** → link trip delays with congestion.  
- **Economic data** (fuel prices, inflation) → analyze effect on ride demand & cancellations.  
- CSV format → compatible with **Python, R, SQL, BI tools** (Tableau, Power BI).  

### 🗂️ Scope
- **Period**: 2024–2025 (daily & weekly ride data).  
- **Coverage**: Ride-hailing transactions (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete).  
- **Columns**:  
  - Date & Time of booking.  
  - Booking ID & Customer ID.  
  - Booking status (Completed, Cancelled, etc.).  
  - Vehicle type (Auto, Go Mini, Go Sedan, eBike, UberXL, etc.).  
  - Pickup & Drop locations.  
  - Avg VTAT (Vehicle Time at Arrival) & Avg CTAT (Customer Time at Arrival).  
- **Possible Analysis**:  
  - Ride demand trends over time.  
  - Cancellation patterns (by driver, customer, no driver found).  
  - Popular pickup & drop-off locations (heatmaps).  
  - Vehicle type utilization.  
  - Customer behavior & retention metrics.  

### 📖 Documentation
- Dataset includes **ride booking details** (transactions & status codes).  
- Additional docs:  
  - Data dictionary (column definitions).  
  - Data cleaning & transformation guide.  
  - Limitations (missing rides, sampling bias, regional coverage).

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 🛠 Data Engineering (DE)
- Data extraction from Kaggle.  
- Cleaning & transformation (handling nulls, standardizing status codes).  
- Building pipelines for integration with external datasets (weather, traffic).  
- Preparing structured data for analytics/BI tools.  

### 📈 Data Analysis (DA)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Trend & demand analysis.  
- Cancellation & utilization analysis.  
- Customer segmentation & retention study.  
- Visualizations & dashboards for ride demand & performance insights.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **Languages**: SQL (T-SQL), Python (for EDA & visualization)  
- **Tools**: Tableau / Power BI  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
